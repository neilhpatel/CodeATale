Read Dr. Dolittle is a web app designed to teach students in middle or high school to read using an interactive learning app that reads aloud, quizzes students on, and provides vocab definitions in the literary classic Dr. Dolittle. 

### Motivation
Illiteracy in children is a major issue - students that cannot read early on often fail to reach their full potential in life. Oftentimes, teachers are unable to separatly tutor individual stuggling students when the parents are unable or unwilling to help. This web-based app is designed to help these struggling students become proficient readers.

### Build Status
Development is finished and codebase is currently ready for handoff to client.

## Install Guide

### 1. Prerequisites
To clone and run this application, you will need [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your computer. To run any of the python files in the backend folder, you will need [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your computer (this is not required to run the actual application).

### 2. Installation
Open a terminal or command prompt.
``` bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/neilhpatel/CodeATale.git
```
Alternatively, you can download ZIP of the repository by clicking on code, and clicking on download ZIP. If you want to simply run the application and do not wish to run any individual files or write to the database, skip to step 4 (Run the application).

``` bash
# Go into the repository
$ cd CodeATale
```
Add ServiceAccountKey.json to the CodeATale/root/backend/src folder. This will allow developers to write words and all corresponding attributes (definition, is_sight_word, is_child_word, parent_word, derivative_words, and block_from_quiz) to the database. The files DefParser.py, DefParser2.py, DefParser3.py, and DefParser4.py require ServiceAccountKey.json to execute.

``` bash
# Install dependencies
python -V #Check python version
pip install -r requirements.txt  #if you have Python 2.x.x
pip3 install -r requirements.txt #if you have Python 3.x.x
```
### 3. Build
No build is necessary for this application.

### 4. Run the application
**Option 1 (recommended): Run index.html using an integrated development environment (IDE). [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/installation-guide.html#standalone), [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installation-guide.html#standalone), and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) can be used.**
    * With IntelliJ/PyCharm, open the repository and navigate to the index.html file located in CodeATale/root/frontend/public/html. At the top right of the file, there should be icons for chrome, Firefox, Safari, and any other browsers. Click on your preferred browser.
    * With VSCode, open the repository. Navigate to the extensions tab on the left sidebar and search and download the extension Live Server by Ritwick Dey in Marketplace (usually first option). After installation, navigate to the index.html file in CodeATale/root/frontend/public/html. Double click anywhere in the file and select ‚ÄúOpen with Live Server‚Äù. Note the default browser opened can be changed by going to Files > Preferences > Settings > Extensions > Live Server > Custom Browser

**Option 2: Run index.html using a Google Chrome extension.**
    * Open Google Chrome and download the [‚ÄúWeb Server for Chrome‚Äù Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en). After installation, click Launch app. Click Choose Folder and navigate to CodeATale/root and select the frontend folder. You should see ‚ÄúCurrent: /frontend‚Äù on the extension page. Now, click on the Web Server URL link and click on public/ and html/ and the application will open.
